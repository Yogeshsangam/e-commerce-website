Introduction
This project is a front-end clone of the Amazon homepage, meticulously designed to replicate its key visual elements and a basic interactive feature. It serves as a demonstration of responsive web design and fundamental JavaScript functionalities within a familiar e-commerce interface.

Features
Responsive Navigation Bar: A sticky navigation bar with Amazon's distinct logo, delivery address, search bar with categories, sign-in, returns & orders, and a shopping cart with a dynamic item counter.

Hero Section: A prominent hero image banner designed to capture attention.

Product Sections: Multiple sections showcasing various product categories (e.g., "Get your game on", "Shop for your home essentials", "Top categories in Kitchen appliances", "New year, new supplies", "Refresh your space", "Shop deals in Fashion", "Toys under $25") with images and "Add to Cart" buttons.

Dynamic Cart Counter: A JavaScript-powered shopping cart counter that updates when an "Add to Cart" button is clicked and provides an alert.

Footer Navigation: A multi-column footer providing links to various Amazon sections like "Get to Know Us" related links.

Hover Effects: Interactive hover effects on navigation elements and product boxes for an enhanced user experience.

Account Dropdown: A mock dropdown menu for account and lists within the sign-in section.

"Back to Top" Feature: A footer element to easily navigate back to the top of the page.

Technologies Used
Frontend:

HTML5 (for structure)

CSS3 (for styling and layout, including Flexbox for alignment)

JavaScript (ES6+) (for dynamic elements like the cart counter)

Font Awesome (for icons)

(Note: amzon.js and amazon.css are used in index.html. The clone.js file and clone.css file are not explicitly linked in the provided index.html for this Amazon clone, but clone.js's content suggests it is intended for cart functionality, and clone.css has Amazon-like styles. For this README, I've assumed amzon.js is the primary JavaScript file and amazon.css is the primary CSS file based on the index.html provided.)

Contributing
As this is a front-end clone for learning purposes, direct contributions are generally not expected. However, feel free to fork the repository to experiment with the code, add new features, or improve existing ones.
